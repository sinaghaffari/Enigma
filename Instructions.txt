Welcome! This is most likely your first time running Enigma!

!!!!YOU ARE GOING TO WANT TO READ THIS!!!!


This is how you play!

Q and E to switch weapons.

Hold Shift to sprint. (You cannot shoot while sprinting)

R to reload (Or you can click when you have no bullets)

The goal of the game is to survive for as long as you can in the zombie apocalypse world. You have a pistol with unlimited ammunition, and an arsenal of other guns that you can buy from the shop.

The shop will open at the end of each wave of zombies.

There are different kindsof zombies:


Walkers  - They are normal walking zombies with base health. Easy stuff, nothing special.

Swarmers - They are fast zombies that swarm you, Be careful they come in packs!

Brutes   - They are massive jaugernaut zombies. They have a lot of health and as you lower
	   their health, they run faster and faster.

Strikers - They are similar to Walkers, except they explode when they die. You have to be
	   very cautious, they do a lot of damage and it's very hard to tell them apart from
	   walkers.
	   
	   HINT: How you can tell is that strikers are actually zombie police men, and soldiers.
	   Just look at their uniform.
